## Description

  During an active day, people have a lot of tasks and responsibilities in their mind. Sometimes, as humans we tend to forget things. Because of that reason, I developed a note taker application that can help people struggling with memorizing everything. This application uses the power of Node.js, Express.js and UUID npm package.
